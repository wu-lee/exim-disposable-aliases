	* v0.3 release

2022-08-21  Nick Stokoe  <nick@noodlefactory.co.uk>

	* Delete file: macros

	It isn't used.

	* Build-Depends: add Perl

	Because we use it in the build!

	* Drop per-alias logfiles in favour of a combined.log file

	This is to avoid needing to detaint the local part in order to be
	able to set the logfile option successfully - tainting checks will
	not allow local_part to be incorporated. Possibly later we can
	revert, if we find the need, and if a justifiably simple and
	secure way of detainting the filename can be found!

	* Set the sqlite_dbfile variable to DISP_ALIASES_DB

	And drop the obsolete per-lookup sqlite loop directives like this:
	
	    ${lookup sqlite{DISP_ALIASES_DB select ... } ... }
	
	In favour of this:
	
	    ${lookup sqlite{select ... } ... }

	And setting sqlite_dbfile.
	
	We would like to retain the per-lookup specific files, mainly so
	we can co-exist with other exim uses of Sqlite3, but since
	tainting checks were added in 4.93, we cannot use that.  Also,
	since per-lookup file options seem not to be present in current
	Debian stable (11) versions of Exim, 4.94.2, we can't use that
	feature yet.  Bump dependency on Exim to 4.94, to require
	implementation of sqlite_dbfile.
